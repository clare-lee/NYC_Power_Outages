## A Deeper Look into Summer Heat and Power Outages


The graph below shows the number power outages that occured in the summer compared to those that occured in the rest of the year. The unusual dip in 2019 is due to missing data for nearly all of July 2019. The "prediction" for the next year is an average of the past years for summer and not summer. The data is limited to only a few years and there are no strong trends through the years, so this prediction actually appears in line with what the next year might be. 

This graph shows that summers are when a significant number of outages occur, but it is difficult to see if there are any trends of increase/decrease in power outages due to lack of historical data prior to March 2014.

The graph below shows the average temperatures, electric comsumption, and power outages in comparison with each other. In order to visualize these three variables in a single plot, power comsumption has been converted to MW. The gap in power comsumption is due to missing data for entirety of 2018. The missing data from power outages is again shown. 

This graph show peaks and dips of these three variables generally align with each other.
