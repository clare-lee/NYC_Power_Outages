# A Deeper Look into Summer Heat and Power Outages

During the summer, black outs are a common occurence despite energy saving measures. The goal of this project is to look into public data of power outages in NYC and see if power outages really are the most common in the summer and to see if is getting better or worse. This is done by visualizing power outage data into graphs.

### Power Outages in the Summer
The graph below shows the number power outages that occured in the summer compared to those that occured in the rest of the year. The unusual dip in 2019 is due to missing data for nearly all of July 2019. It is likely there are other gaps of missing data. The "prediction" for the next year is an average of the previous years for summer and not summer. The data is limited to only a 8 years and there appears to be no strong trends through the years, so the prediction actually appears in line with what the next year might be. 

This graph shows that summers are when a significant number of outages occur compared to the rest of the year, but it is difficult to see if there are any trends of increase/decrease in power outages due to lack of historical data prior to March 2014.

### Comparison
The graph below shows the average temperatures, electric comsumption, and power outages in comparison with each other. In order to visualize these three variables in a single plot, power comsumption has been converted to MW. The gap in power comsumption is due to missing data for entirety of 2018. The missing data from power outages is again shown. 

This graph show peaks and dips of these three variables generally align with each other. Most of the data appears cyclically with no strong trends.

Limitations: 
What is considered a power outages are power outage complaints as actual data of power outages was not publically available. The data starts from March 2014 and has gaps of missing data which limits the ability to see trends.
